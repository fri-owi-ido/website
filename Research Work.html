            <li class="list" style="text-align: justify;margin-right: 40px; line-height: 25px;"">Abstract: This master thesis aims to design a methodology for utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) models in the empathize stage of the design thinking (DT) process. This stage relies heavily on user research, which is time-intensive and subject to biases such
                as personal opinions and stereotypes. AI models can analyze large datasets and identify patterns more quickly than humans. However, utilizing AI models in this stage presents challenges, including the selection of appropriate AI models, data
                types, model biases, hallucination, and ethical considerations. The study employed qualitative research based on expert interviews to gather insights from industry professionals on the potential and limitations of AI in design thinking. The insights
                from the gathered data and reviewed literature were instrumental in developing a methodology that incorporates AI in the empathize stage, visualized using a swimlane flowchart. Additionally, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform prototype,
                based on the methodology, was designed using Figma, demonstrating practical use cases for AI integration in this stage. A business model was also developed to showcase the value proposition and market potential of the product. The research
                represents a paradigm shift in the application of DT and offers practitioners new directions for utilizing AI in the empathize stage, paving the way for more effective and efficient user research and better-designed products and services.
